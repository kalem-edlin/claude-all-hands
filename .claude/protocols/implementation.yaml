steps:
  1: |
    Call `envoy plan read-prompt <prompt_num> [<variant>]` to get full prompt context
  2: |
    Derive WORKTREE_BRANCH: `<FEATURE_BRANCH>/implementation-<PROMPT_NUM>[-<VARIANT>]`
    * This naming convention signals to git checkout hook to skip plan matter creation
    * All envoy plan commands read from FEATURE_BRANCH's plan directory, not the worktree
  3: |
    Call `envoy plan start-prompt <PROMPT_NUM> [<VARIANT>] --specialist "<AGENT_NAME>" --worktree "<WORKTREE_BRANCH>"`
  4: |
    Check if worktree branch <WORKTREE_BRANCH> (following `*/implementation-*` naming pattern from step 2) already exists
    * If branch does NOT exist: Create worktree with branch: <WORKTREE_BRANCH>
    * If branch EXISTS:
      * Checkout the existing worktree branch
      * Call `envoy git diff-base` to read the git diff of this branch against the base branch (main/master)
      * Review the current implementation shown in the diff to understand what has already been done
      * Continue implementation ONLY if needed (if work is incomplete or needs refinement)
      * Resume workflow from the appropriate step based on current state (e.g., if implementation is complete, proceed to review step)
  5: |
    **Initialize ITERATION = 1, REFINEMENT_REASON = ""**
    * If resuming from existing branch: adjust ITERATION and REFINEMENT_REASON based on current state
  6: |
    Create todo list with TodoWrite for prompt implementation
  7: |
    Implement todo list
  8: |
    **Call `envoy plan record-implementation <PROMPT_NUM> [<VARIANT>] --walkthrough "<STRUCTURED_WALKTHROUGH>" --iteration <ITERATION> [--refinement-reason "<REFINEMENT_REASON>"]`**
    * Generate walkthrough with type = "initial" for ITERATION 1, appropriate refinement type for ITERATION > 1
  9: |
    Call `envoy gemini review <PROMPT_NUM> [<VARIANT>]`
    * Returns: { verdict, thoughts?, answered_questions?, suggested_changes? }
  10: |
    If suggested_changes:
    * **Increment ITERATION, set REFINEMENT_REASON = "Review feedback: {summary of changes}"**
    * Implement adjustments considering `thoughts`, answered_questions, and suggested_changes
    * **Call `envoy plan record-implementation <PROMPT_NUM> [<VARIANT>] --walkthrough "<STRUCTURED_WALKTHROUGH>" --iteration <ITERATION> --refinement-reason "<REFINEMENT_REASON>"`**
    * Generate walkthrough with type = "review-refinement"
  11: |
    Commit (repeat review until verdict = passed)
  12: |
    If requires_manual_testing, call `envoy plan block-prompt-testing-gate <PROMPT_NUM> [<VARIANT>]`
    * Returns: { thoughts, passed, refinements?, logs? }
    * If passed = false:
      * **Increment ITERATION, set REFINEMENT_REASON = "Testing feedback: {summary of refinements}"**
      * **Go to step 7** (re-implement from todo list, generate walkthrough with type = "testing-refinement")
  13: |
    Call `envoy plan block-prompt-variants-gate <PROMPT_NUM> <VARIANT>`
    * Returns immediately if not a variant prompt
    * Returns: { thoughts, variant_solution, reason, unmerged_alternatives?: [branch_names] }
    * **Multi-variant acceptance model:**
      * `main`: This variant is merged to feature branch (exactly ONE per prompt number)
      * `alternative`: Worktree preserved, prompt shows variant_solution="alternative", NOT merged
        * User can manually cherry-pick/feature-flag later
      * `discard`: Archive branch (`git branch -m <b> archive/<b>`), remove worktree
    * If variant_solution = "discard": archive branch, remove worktree, return { merged: false }
    * If variant_solution = "alternative": preserve worktree, update prompt, return { merged: false }
    * If variant_solution = "main": continue to merge
  14: |
    Commit remaining changes, merge worktree to feature branch (MAIN variant only)
    * Resolve conflicts based on commit messages
  15: |
    Call `envoy plan complete-prompt <PROMPT_NUM> [<VARIANT>]`
    * Reports unmerged alternative worktrees in response for user awareness
